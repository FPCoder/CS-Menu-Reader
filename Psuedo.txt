Menu Assignment:

Psuedo:

Part 1:

read file
for each item and price
	push into corresponding vectors

Part 2:
for remaining files
	check item vector for each item on menu
	if not on menu
		push item and price into corresponding vectors
	if on menu
		add price at item name location in price vector, increment reccurence vector at location by 1

Part 3:

for each item in vector
	print item name
	print price/reccurence

------

Parts subject to change, let me know if the assignment should be distributed differently

Update:
The program is now written to have all the data accessible in the "Counts" class.
It makes the main() function look less cluttered to have a class that keeps track of all the vectors
and since we only need a few operations, creating functions that can access the data is easier this way.
For example, if we create a reading function for main it would look like:

void readFile(string fileName, vector<double> prices, vector<string> names, vector<int> recurrences);

TODO:
print the average and clean up the print() function already in place.
    -It currently just prints the state of the vectors, but this is not how the program should work.
